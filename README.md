# courier-app
An app developed for and by writers to easily share grammar and spell-checked stories in customizable groups.

## Description:

The purpose of this project was to create a full-stack application so that writers using our app would be able to interact with one another, share writing samples, have their samples spell- and grammar-checked, and join user-created groups. Our team wanted to create this app to provide writers with a user-friendly website that would ultimately assist their writing. In order to accomplish this, we required Node.js, Express.js, Handlebars, MySQL2, and Sequelize. Much of the code required the use of GET and POST routes in order to create a functional API. We also used authentication practices involving cookies, brcypt, and express-session so that the user experience relies on them being securely logged in to the app. We used a new (to us) library - Bulma - in order to stylize the front end in a visually appealing way. We also specifically wanted a way for users to be able to upload a PDF of a writing sample and have the contents expressed in text-form; for this, we used PDF Parse. Most of what we learned was furthering our understanding of Handlebars and controllers, as these were very dynamic, detail-specific, and interconnected. We accomplished our basic goals for this project and look forward to how we can further enhance Courier App.
